This is the old CVS repository of GNU AUCTeX.  It is *obsolete*!  Don't commit
here anymore!  (Hopefully, it's configured so that it doesn't accept commits
anymore.)

GNU AUCTeX now uses Git for version control.  The git repository is linked from
the savannah AUCTeX project page:

  https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/auctex

Everyone who had commit access for this old CVS repository now has push access
for the Git repository.
