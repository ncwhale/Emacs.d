If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value form the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     'ignore)

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to
`async-ready' or `async-wait'.

You can also run this command in the batch mode as follows:

  emacs -f w3m http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/ &

In that case, or if this command is called non-interactively, the
variables `w3m-pop-up-windows' and `w3m-pop-up-frames' will be ignored
\(treated as nil) and it will run emacs-w3m at the current (or the
initial) window.

If the optional NEW-SESSION is non-nil, this function makes a new
emacs-w3m buffer.  Besides that, it also makes a new emacs-w3m buffer
if `w3m-make-new-session' is non-nil and a user specifies a url string.

The optional INTERACTIVE-P is for the internal use; it is mainly used
to check whether Emacs 22 or later calls this function as an
interactive command in the batch mode.
